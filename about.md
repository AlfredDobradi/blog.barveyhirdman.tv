My name is Alfred Dobradi and I'm a 27 year old programmer from Hungary, trying to
do this strimstram thing. My ultimate goal is to go full-time with this, currently
trying to establish a good schedule that balances well with my job.

I had my first livestream in around the end of 2011, playing Euro Truck Simulator
without a cam or even talking. It was kinda pointless but I had fun doing it, so I
didn't really care back then. After a while I started using a camera and switched to
playing Torchlight 2. I used to have a couple of regular viewers back then and I
had two decent 24 hour marathons donating a few hundred bucks to charity.

You can guess, this didn't last too long and life got in the way, but I realized
recently that I need casting more than ever. Ever since I got back on to Twitch I
made lots of new friends and have had a really good time. I'm struggling with lots
some emotional and mental issues, but streaming and being part of these communities
help immensely.

Well here I am now, still not giving up on the dream.
