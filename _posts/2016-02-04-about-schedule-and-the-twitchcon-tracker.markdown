There've been two changes regarding my stream recently. One is bigger, the other one is just a visual thing, but I wanted to write a few words about them anyway.

First, about the schedule. Since I have a full-time job and I'm only casting as a hobby, it's really hard to find a timeslot where I can give everything I can and not be tired/salty about work. It's been a long road finding this interval of the day and I'm not even sure it's the perfect one, but for now it seems like it should work in the long run.

I usually work until 5pm, but sometimes have to do overtime and I even do some real-life socializing from time to time, so it's unmanageable to go home straight from work and start casting. I figured I'd need some time after I finish, go home, take a shower, grab something to eat, vent about things that happened during work time. This ~3 hours let me do that. I get home, drink a coffee, watch Netflix, take a nap, recharge myself by 8pm and then start the stream. After I wrap up the cast - usually between 11 and 12pm - I still have lots of time to sleep, even if I decide to stay up and chill at a friend's stream or do something else. It seems to work perfectly for now.

Now the tracker. I have to admit, I don't really like to ask for donations. I don't even advertise the donation url although I have a command for it in my bot. BUT. I want to get to TwitchCon. And from my current position it really seems like I might have to start doing that. However, the tracker is not there to ask for money or to promote how skint I am, it's there to motivate me. It'll grow month by month as I save money from my day job. It'll have to grow and one day it'll be at 100%. It's there for me.
