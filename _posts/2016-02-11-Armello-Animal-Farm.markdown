Just a quick disclaimer: I've only played the prologue and a couple of AI games, this post is based on the little experience I have with the game.

I ran into this game on the first day of the Lunar New Year sale on Steam. I was playing the choose-your-own-adventure kinda minigame and browsing the recommended games. I've been through like 30 games already, some made it to the wishlist but I didn't really had the feeling, you know, the *I NEED TO HAVE THIS GAME* one. Then came Armello. Looked at the screenshots, read the description, even watched the videos - and I almost never do that. The feeling came. I needed to have it.

I bought it yesterday at work, I was so excited I just had to see it. I installed it on my work machine and started it. By the time I finished the first episode of the prologue I was hooked. I couldn't wait to get home and play it. I can't even remember when I felt this way about a game the last time.

The reason I like the game so much is the compelling atmosphere, the amazing graphics and of course the mechanics. I love board games, I love card games and I'm always in for some dice rolling action. This game has all of those.

There's a hex-grid based map with different types of tiles where you can move and fight using action points each turn. Battles are resolved using dice rolls and you have means to crank your chances up if need be. You can use spells, set up traps, equip items and recruit companions on the map - that's a free action so to speak, it doesn't require AP, but other resources. Everything plays very fluidly, it's very easy to pick the game up.

The main conflict of the game is the king going mad because of "The Rot" and dying slowly. The players only have time until the king dies or one of them collects four Spirit Stones and banishes the king. There are several ways to win the game, you can read about them on the Wiki, but the tutorial will also explain them. This makes sure everybody can play the game the way it suits them and their character the best.

There's of course a Multiplayer mode in the game but I haven't tried it yet, maybe if I feel a bit more experienced. There's also a disabled Ranked button - not sure if it's not implemented or only locked for me until I play some unranked skirmishes, but either way I can't wait to click it and try.

So this was my kinda chaotic post about the game, but I really hope it will at least make you look it up. It's worth it.
