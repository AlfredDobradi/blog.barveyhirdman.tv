Since I'm a dingus and usually forget something when going live with my stream, I compiled a little checklist for myself. I highly recommend writing checklists for everything requiring more than 3-4 steps becuause if anyone's as prone to making errors as me, it will benefit you greatly. Here's my going live checklist.

- Start Spotify
- Start Snaz
- Start OBS
- Open Dashboard
- Set channel title, game
- Tweet out the thing
- Check on bot
- Start game
- Start stream

I try to separate every little step, merging things can lead to one thing being done and one forgotten so I try to avoid these scenarios. It only takes one tick more anyway so not a huge effort. :)
