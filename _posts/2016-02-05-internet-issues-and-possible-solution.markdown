As I already mentioned a couple of times on stream, I have lots of issues with my internet speed. To be perfectly honest, it's not even my internet subscription. Last year I had to move from my previous flat, because the landlord decided to sell it, but it actually turned out fine, except this little internet-fiasco.

When I moved in, there was already a subscription installed with the devices and everything by the previous tenant. We agreed with the owners to replace it as soon as possible, but I figured out a way I could hijack the sub and use it myself so I didn't think it's necessary until I got back into streaming. The current internet package is a bit slow to do that, I can't even play games that require internet usage (Elite: Dangerous, Guild Wars 2) because the stream gets jittery and unwatchable. Even when playing Our Darker Purpose these last few days, people had to buffer a lot and I'm fairly sure the issue is on my end. So I decided last month: this can't continue.

I did submit the request right away, but turned out they can only cancel the current plan if the previous tenant is there and cancels. I contacted the owners, maybe they can do something, but turns out they don't have a say in it, even though it's their flat. One of them got back to me this morning with some interesting news this morning though, they called the previous tenant and they figured they can just transfer the subscription to my name.

The plan has an advantage, but also one flaw. The biggest advantage would be that I don't have to be without internet. They just transfer it and it's on. The flaw? Well it still stays at the shitty speed it's currently at. I need to request the upgrade separately, which will take time and I'll probably also have to pay extra for it, although still cheaper than getting a fresh service.

I'm currently waiting for the owners to get back to me regarding the date we have to go to the provider's office and take care of things. Hopefully it won't take long.
