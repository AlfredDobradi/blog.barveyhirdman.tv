I've been thinking lately and came up with a couple of ideas that could help getting people together and having fun. I already posted about the Twitter chat, so I won't touch that subject in depth, but there has been improvements in both people wanting to get involved and idea-wise as well so it'll definitely happen.

Other things I've been thinking about were RP'ing on stream and tournaments. Bear in mind, I don't want to promote or build my own channel (or at least, not in a direct way and not only that) but want to work with others in cooperation to have fun. I look at growth as a side-product. I'm having fun playing games even when nobody watches, so growing my channel is not a must for me. It's a good thing of course, I love to see someone pop in and saying hi, who doesn't?

That's why I thought the two things mentioned before would work well. I don't have to explain how role playing would, I guess, probably everyone's watched at least one RP stream in their life. The tournaments would however give an edge to things. Being in a competitive scenario makes things a bit more heated, a bit more exciting. They could be team tournaments or individual ones, it doesn't matter: competition is the key.

I'm not sure how many people would be interested in such nights or sessions, but it would be smashing to try. First in small, then we'll see.
