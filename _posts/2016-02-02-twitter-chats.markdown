So I've been thinking and figured there could be some kind of Twitter chat for people
who stream or watch streams, to share experiences, preferences even and to do a bit of
networking.

These Twitter chats usually just incorporate a pre-defined hashtag and one or more
moderators who post the questions. This is only brainstorming really, I'm currently
set out to ask some people how they like the idea, involve both viewers, moderators
and streamers.

If you're interested, don't hold back, send me a message on Twitter or chuck a Tweet
at me!
