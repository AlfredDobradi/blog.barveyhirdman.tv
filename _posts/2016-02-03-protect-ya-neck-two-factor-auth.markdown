Today [Zcotticus](http://twitch.tv/zcotticus) mentioned the Two-Factor Auth on Twitch
and I realized not only I don't have it enabled, I didn't even know it existed. I'm
a huge fan of 2FA and I always use it and I really recommend everyone doing the same.
This is not really a step-by-step tutorial since there aren't many steps to do.

First things first, you'll need a phone with Android or iOS on it to be able to get
the app needed, if you have one, you're all set.

Now you'll have to log in to Twitch and either go to your Security & Privacy settings
from the Settings menu, or just use [this link here](https://secure.twitch.tv/settings/security).
You'll see a link labeled Enable two-factor authentication, which opens a modal, asking
for your phone number. After you submit, check your phone, you should receive a text
with a code you have to enter in the field.

When you're done with that, you'll get links to Authy's store pages on Play Store and App
Store. I'd recommend just downloading the app from the store on your phone, but whatever
floats your boat. The application will ask for your phone number again, and it will send
another message which you can use to identify your phone. If everything went right
you should already see the Twitch account listed in Authy.

You're finished with the setup, next time you're logging in to Twitch you'll have to launch
the app and use the token on your phone's screen and that's it.

Congratulations, your Twitch account is now protected!
